# TTM4205-Glitching-Feasibility-and-Side-Channel-Analysis-of-Raspberry-Pi-3B-v1.2-and-4B

This repository contains code for the TTM4205 Secure Cryptographic Implementations technical essay. The project goal was to study and understand the feasibility of glitching the Raspberry Pi 3b v2 and Raspberry Pi 4b platforms. The repository consists of the following sections: 

- [Injecting Glitch Attacks](/glitch-attacks/README.md)
- [Recording Power Traces](/recording-power-traces/README.md)
- [Target Programs](/target-programs/README.md)
- [Miscellaneous](/miscellaneous/README.md)

NOTE: The repository has been stripped out of all additional files, such as images of traces and trace data. Some of these files may be provided on request.
